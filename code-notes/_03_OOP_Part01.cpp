	/* Object Oriented Programming:-
	 * ------------------------------
	 * Objects are the fundamental building blocks rather than the Code Algorithm.
	 * 	- Program is created as a collection of Objects.
	 * 	- Every Object is an instance of a (Class == Datatype in other word).
	 * 	- Some classes can have relationship, via inheritance.
	 * 	- OOP simulate interaction between Objects.
	 * 	- Make code more reusable, extensible, and maintainable.
	 * 	- Basic principles to write OO Programs:
	 * 		- Abstraction:
	 * 			- Represent real-life objects in software, without the associated complexity.
	 * 			- Represented through class, struct, interface, union and enum.
	 * 			- Focus on important necessary details and Left out unwanted features.
	 * 			- Help focus on important characteristics.
	 * 		- Encapsulation:
	 * 			- Hide Implementation details of a class.
	 * 			- Class provide behavior without revealing the implementation.
	 * 			- This Implementation can be changed, without user knowledge.
	 * 			-
	 * 		- Inheritance:
	 * 			-
	 * 		- Polymorphism:
	 * 			-
